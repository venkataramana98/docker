Docker registry is used to store the images. Docker hub is the default registry
It has 2 types: 
Cloud based registry- 1)Docker hub 
                      2)GCR - Google container registry
                      3)Amazon ECR0 Elastic container registry

Local Registry- 1)Nexus
                2)Jfrog
                3)DTR - Docker trusted Registry

Steps to create and push an IMG to docker hub: 
Step-1: WE HAVE TO TAKE THE CODE FROM DEVELOPERS
Step-2: WRITE A DOCKER FILE AS PER THE SOURCE CODE
Step-3: BUILD THE DOCKER FILE THEN IMAGE WILL GETS CREATED
Step-4: PUSH THE IMAGE TO DOCKER HUB
Step-5: TAG THE IMAGE (command - docker tag local-image:tagname new-repo:tagname
Step-6: LOGIN INTO DOCKER HUB FROM SERVER (command - docker login)
Step-7: PUSH THE IMAGE (command - docker push new-repo:tagname)


Now to automate the process, we will use jenkins:
