Difference between docker pull and docker run: 
When we use docker pull, the image will be downloaded from the dockerhub irrespective of the presence of image in local. This will not create a container. 
When we use docker run, the server will check for the image in local, if it couldnt find, it will get it from central registry and create a container. 

To know the full information of container: docker inspect container_name
To know the full information of IMAGE: docker image inspect image_name

how are you today?
