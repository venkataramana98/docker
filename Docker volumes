Docker volumes : Are used to store the data inside a container and top replicate that data to any other container. 
Points to remember: 
1) When we create a container, then volume will be created. 
2) Volume is simply a directory inside our container. 
3) first, we have to declare the directory volume and then share colume. 



Command to create a container: docker run -it --name container_name  -v path_of_volume  image_name
To exit a container: ctrl + p + q
Command to share valume of a container: docker run -it --name container_name  --privileged=true  --volumes-from previous_container_name  image_name
